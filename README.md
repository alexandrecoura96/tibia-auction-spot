# Tibia Auction Spot
This is a project developed in React Native for study purposes, inspired by the Tibia game. The goal is to consume an API that performs webscraping on the game's website, bringing information about the characters that are on the Tibia bazaar.

The application allows users to view the characters available in the Tibia bazaar, as well as filter by world, vocation or sorting. In addition, the user can view details of the selected character, such as their description and skill levels.
